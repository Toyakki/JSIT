## Principles of Universal Design
1. Equitable use
- Works with screen readers
- In the future, more accessibility features for creational and navigational features could be implemented, such as voice commands.
2. Flexibility in use
- Our project is open-source, written using SOLID principles and clean architecture, and is thus easily extendable; in particular, to add more accessibility features as mentioned elsewhere in this document.
- But other than being easily extendable and being compatible with elsewhere mentioned accessibility features, this doesn't really apply to our project.
3. Simple and intuitive use
- Our software is low-text, and besides having to type to input text like course codes and log in information, it can be navigated and engaged with via a mouse.
- All text fields are labelled with what should be entered, all buttons are labelled according to their function.
- Each feature: creating a course, joining a course, creating an assignment, submitting an assignment, and grading an assignment, is performable in view and without extra menus, etc.  
4. Perceptible information
- We used a simple two-tone colour palette and minimal layout .
- The assignment creation, course creation, and course joining menus all have labelled text fields and labelled buttons.
- Courses view and course view displays all relevant data in a simple table or list, making it easy to see.
5. Tolerance for error
- Currently, we have implemented error labels in the teacher course view to handle when, for example, a user forgets to upload a file when creating an assignment.
- In the future, more error labels, in particular in the student courses and course views, and more detailed error messages with steps for resolution would further increase the program's tolerance for error.
6. Low physical effort
- Currently, one could navigate the program using just a mouse with a popup keyboard.
- However, at the moment this barrier to use is fixed; in the future, a voice command feature for navigation and functionality would decrease the physical effort required to use the program.
7. Size and space for approach and use
- Not applicable, in our case, since engaging with our software is done digitally.
