## Summery
JSIT is an open source simple tool for creating, submitting, and grading assignments 
for teachers and students which allows for the easy expansion of functionality.

Current open source assignments submission and grading solutions are based on 
complicated code bases and require complex cloud set up. This slows down educational
technology professionals in creating learning solutions tailored to their institution's
unique learning need.

To solve the problem of complicated assignments submission and grading solutions 
we implemented an system with an intuitive architecture utilizing a code architecture
which allows for expansion which allow for the easy addition of new features. In addition,
we utilize dropbox creating a simple set up for cloud functionality.
